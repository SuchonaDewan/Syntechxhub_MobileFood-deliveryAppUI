## Project Overview
This project is a **mobile application UI/UX design**, created to provide a smooth, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience. The design focuses on:  

- **User-friendly navigation:** Simple flows with clear actions and minimal friction.  
- **Consistent visual hierarchy:** Typography, color, and spacing guide users naturally.  
- **Clean and modern aesthetics:** Minimalist screens that emphasize usability.  
- **Interactive prototype-ready screens:** Exported assets for easy handoff to developers.  

The project includes **all screens, icons, and PNG/SVG assets** to ensure full implementation feasibility.

## UX Rationale : Also shared a doc file in detail
The design decisions were guided by these principles:  

1. **Ease of use:** Buttons, gestures, and navigation are optimized for quick comprehension.  
2. **Accessibility:** Text, color contrast, and iconography ensure readability and clarity.  
3. **Consistency:** Repeated UI patterns for familiarity across screens.  
4. **Engagement:** Visual hierarchy and interactive elements maintain user attention without clutter.  
5. **Scalability:** Layout and component design allow for future expansion and additional screens.
